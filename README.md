## Tech Stack And Tools‚ú®
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, used for building scalable network applications.
- **Express.js:** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, used for building APIs and web applications.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used for storing data in a flexible, JSON-like format.
- **Mongoose:** An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used to model application data and interact with the database.

- **Redis:** An in-memory data store used as a database and cache to improve application performance and speed up data access.

- **Vercel:** A cloud platform for deploying web applications, offering automatic scaling, previews, and global CDN for improved performance.
- **Stripe:** A payment gateway used to facilitate secure online payments between customers and Admin.
- **Multer:** A middleware used to handle file uploads in Node.js applications, used to upload images and files to the server.
- **Cloudinary:** A cloud-based service for managing and storing images and videos, offering APIs for uploading, compressing, and optimizing media. It enhances media processing and supports fast distribution via a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
- **Nodemailer:** A module used to send emails from the application to users for account verification, order confirmation, and other events.

- **Morgan:** An HTTP request logger middleware used to log HTTP requests and responses for debugging and monitoring.
- **PDFKit:** A JavaScript library for creating PDF documents in Node.js, allowing developers to generate dynamic PDFs with customizable content and layouts.
- **rateLimit:** A middleware used in web applications to limit the number of requests a user can make to an API within a specified time period, helping to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of resources.


## Features

### Core Features 
- **User Authentication:** Authenticates users using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Redis Integration:** Redis is utilized for caching frequently accessed data and optimizing query performance, ensuring optimal scalability and responsiveness of the application. Implemented cart with Redis server for faster data retrieval.

- **Sales Analysis:** Provides the total order amount within a user-defined period and generates daily reports of the orders along with their total prices.

- **Product Management:** Allows Admin to create, update, and delete products.

- **Product Listing:** Displays products with details such as name, price, description, and images.
- **Shopping Cart:** Enables customers to add products to a cart, view the cart, and proceed to checkout.
- **Order Management:** Allows Admin to manage orders, view order details, and update order status.
- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Integrates with Stripe for secure online payments between customers and Admin.
- **User Profile:** Allows users to manage their profiles, update personal information, and view order history.
- **Search and Filter:** Enables customers to search for products based on keywords, categories, and other criteria.
- **Product Reviews:** Allows customers to leave reviews and ratings for products.
- **Order Tracking:** Enables customers to track the status of their orders.
## Additional Features

- **Email Confirmation Cleanup:** Deletes unconfirmed emails from the database after a period of 15 to 30 days.

- **Email Notifications:** Sends automated email notifications to users for account verification, order confirmation, and other events.
- **Wishlist Functionality  :** Users can add any product to their wishlist and make changes to their wishlist as needed. If a product is out of stock and a user wishes to purchase it, the user's ID is added to the wishlist associated with that product.

- **Logging and Monitoring:** Includes logging functionality using Winston and Morgan to track application behavior and performance.
- **Error Handling:** Implements error handling mechanisms to catch and handle exceptions gracefully, providing informative error messages to users.
- **API Documentation:** Provides comprehensive documentation for APIs using tools like Swagger to facilitate code maintenance and collaboration.
- **Code Version Control:** Utilizes version control systems such as Git to track code changes.
- **Environment Configuration:** Utilizes environment variables to manage configuration settings and sensitive information, ensuring security and flexibility.
- **Best Practices & Clean Code:** Follows best practices and clean code principles to ensure code quality, maintainability, and scalability.


## ArchitectureüèóÔ∏è

The backend follows a modular, scalable, and maintainable architecture, Express.js, and MongoDB. The architecture is designed to ensure code reusability, separation of concerns, and scalability to accommodate future growth and changes in the application's requirements.


## Database Schema üìä

The database used for ecommerce is MongoDB, a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format.

The database schema for ecommerce consists of the following collections:

- **Users:** Stores user information such as name, email, password, and wishlist products.
- **Products:** Stores product information such as name, price, description, images, and wishlist users.
- **Orders:** Stores order information such as customer details, product details, order status, and payment details.
- **Reviews:** Stores review information such as product ID, customer ID, rating, comment, and timestamps.
- **Carts:** Stores cart information such as user ID, product ID, quantity, and total cart price.
- **Categories:** Stores category information such as name, description, and subcategories.
- **Subcategories:** Stores subcategory information such as name, description, and parent category.
- **Brands:** Stores brand information such as name, description, and products.
- **Coupons:** Stores coupon information such as name, expiration date, discount amount, and usage limit.

## RESTful API Designüìê

The API design for ecommerce follows RESTful principles, with clear and predictable URL structures, HTTP methods, and status codes. The API endpoints are organized into resource-based routes, with each route corresponding to a specific resource or entity in the system. The API design includes the following key features:

- **Resource-Based Routes:** Organizes API endpoints into resource-based routes such as /users, /products, and /orders.
- **CRUD Operations:** Implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for all resources using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
- **Sales Analysis:** Provides the total order amount within a user-defined period and generates daily reports of the orders along with their total prices
- **Pagination and Filtering:** Supports pagination and filtering for listing resources.
- **Search and Sorting:** Allows users to search for resources based on keywords, categories, and other criteria, enhancing resource discovery.
- **Error Handling:** Provides informative error messages, status codes, and error responses to help clients understand and handle errors effectively.
